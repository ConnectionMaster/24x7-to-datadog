# 24x7-to-datadog
This is a quick work to send some 24x7 API metrics to Datadog

## Type of metrics managed:
- `reports/summary/{monitor_id}` : getting the uptime of a monitor
- `current_status/{monitor_id}` : getting response time of a monitor accros locations

## TODO:
Feel free to submit your PR!
